##Tasks
* Firstly, users can randomly input the number of circles, the numbers of blocks and the direct position of each block.
* Secondly, due to the user's input, the algorithm can initialize the blocks and fix the problem of formatting.
* Thirdly, due to the initialized blocks, the algorithm can solve the problem to finding the proper X-axis,,Y-axis,radius to make the sum of the areas of circles biggest.
* Forthly, calculate the sum of the areas of the circles.
* Finally, output the result of the sum.
